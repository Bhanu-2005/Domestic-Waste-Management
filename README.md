        <h2>ABOUT D.W.M</h2>
        <p>Domestic waste (also known as household waste) is any waste that is generated in the home from day-to-day activities.</p>
        <p>What is Domestic Waste Management?:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Domestic waste disposal is an issue that is important to the management of any urban area. Cities without a functioning waste-disposal plan face risks of disease running rampant.</li>
            <li>economic activity grinding to a halt.</li>
            <li>The majority of North American cities use the sanitary-landfill method of waste disposal.</li>
            <li> which has served fairly well for quite a while; however, in situations where space is at a premium.</li>
            <li>incineration and material-recycling-based waste disposal are more likely to come to the forefront..</li>
        </ul>
